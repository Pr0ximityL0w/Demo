      <h1>* What we do - Services *</h1>
      <h3>* Felling, Pruning, Removal, Clearance *</h3>
      <div class="two-col">
        <p>Whichever service you require be reassured to know that all work is carried out to the highest of standards, inline with NPTC (National Proficiency Tests Council) Certification and BS3998 (British Standard for Tree Work) regulations, we are fully insured (Through ArboRisk) and all our documents can be seen on request.</p>
          Being Qualified through the NPTC we are able to fell all manner of tree sizes starting from shrub and hedge, through Forestry and onto Emergency Operations, which covers catastrophic failure be that from decay or due to weather.</p>
          We are able to conduct climbing operations too, we understand the importance of trees and their place in our society and often in our customers hearts, there for we strive to offer every possible solution not just the Felling of Trees.</p>
          You and your tree may just require an health inspection, which being conducted airily can allow us to be the most thorough, we can spot potential hazards early be that disease or decay, fungal or faliure.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="two-col">
        <p>We provide pruning and shaping, lifting and reduction of the crown, dead wood removal and crown cleaning, aswell as reduction of the canopys density, allowing more light to pass through the canopy (This also allows wind through, which reduces the stress that can lead to failure), we are also able to conduct pollarding, this is primarily to maintain trees at a determined height.</p>
          Through Experience we can employ techniques which can allow us to safely and securely dismantle tree’s in tight places and even enter a canopy in order to recover pets.</p>
          Our tree surgeons have carried out their services for many  people and sectors, from domestic and residential customers and areas through to the commercial and trade sectors.</p>
          We happily collaborate with local trade, from supply to gardeners, we are also proud to work for or alongside our local landscapers, both planning the project if required and conducting all necessary tree work and stump/root removal.
          All waste will be disposed of in a safe and ecologically friendly way, we strive to recycle and embrace our duties towards our enviroment and carbon foot print.</p>

      <h2>* A little about us *</h2>
      <div class="two-col">
        <p>Having previously served tweleve years in Her Majesties Forces, we have the British Armys vaules and standards firmly engrained. Honesty and Integraty are our primary modus operandi, we strive to be punctual, well turned out and presented, loyal to our customers and comunity, respectful to all other parties and when we leave, we leave the area imaculate and any descrepancies will be imidatly rectified.</p>
        HH Treecare started it's journy by establishing a solid foundation of training through Mr Darbishire at SawPod Training, Tony is able to share with us a wealth of knowledge, himself being an instructor in Arboriculture training since 1987. His resumae would require a website of it's own, however his highlights would invole teraching at both Merrist Wood (Surrey) and Sparsholt College (Hampshire) before establishing his own school of training in Andover. His career has taken him all over the world, from Australia and France through too the Indonesian island of Sumatra in the cause of protection of the critically endangered Sumatran orangutan population.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="two-col">
        <p>We then found it critical to implement an action plan in the case of emergancies, climbing and saw work is inherantly dangerous and there maybe situations where we are called upon for a rapid response in the case of Emergancy Tree Work. Already having an operation background in First Aid through the military and exposure to hostile enviroments, we needed to transfer this skill set into the civilian sector, having now achived Certification through VTQ we look to further develope ourselves by current with legislation and procidures aswell as routienly conductiong rehersals in the case of a medical emergancy, we also look to gain further Certification which will then allow us to provide our own Training Packages. In the aspect of Emergancy Tree Works, we are qualified and have had the best of opertinties working along side the Enviromental Agency (Insert Link). This has given us real time experiance in the dismantle of windblown, uprouted and failed tree's, of many defferent spieces which all reqiure slightly different approches using all manner of different techniques, including winching, working around and actually in (Both Trees and Operators fully submerged) the River Don.</p>
        We are also grateful we have had the opertunities to Train and Work within the Utility Arborcultral Industry and along side HighWays England which involved Cutting and Clearing along the roadside both at Day and Night.</p>

      <h3>* Plans for the Future - Right Now and Down the Line *</h3>
      <div class="two-col">
        <p>Whilst HH Treecare as a brand is still in its infancy, we look to continue our educational development by enroling with the RFS (insert link) proving and cementing our Arborcultual knowledge, before moving towards Accreditation with the Arboricultural Association (insert link). We want shoulder to shoulder with most qulified and reconised Tree Care companies in the UK, being at the top of our game, we want you to be the upmost assured you have made the right choice by calling on us and your assets are in the safest of hands, from start to finish and with any aftercare you require. Even if it's just for some impartial advice, we want to be on hand and want you to be fully confidant.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="two-col">
        <p>We are looking to add Lawn Care, Planting and Proffesional Gardening to our avalible Services as of now, we also look to liase with Local Authority, Business and already established companies in our local area in order to impliment a solid action plan incase of Emergancy, with 24 Hour call out, to cover disaster relif be that tree failure or flood.</p>
          We also look towards control and eradication of invasive and hazardus species comercially and residentially, in the most ecological and sustainable ways. </p>
